## Determine HOW the AnimalClassTester can be modified so that is can be closed for modification.
#### AnimalClassTester can be modified so that it can be closed for modification by utilizing an abstract class parameter of Animal to handle all different variations of the extended Animal class.

## Determine HOW the different animal classes are similar.
#### Different animal classes are similar in that they all have three parts, a name, a food, and an action.

## Determine HOW you to make the existing animal classes polymorphic.
#### Existing animal classes can be modified to incorperate the abstract Animal class and its abstract functions which perform the same functions as what is already included but with different names sometimes.

## Refactor the various animal classes.
#### The various animal classes can be refactored by changing them to extend the abstract Animal class and utilize its various asbtract functions.

## Refactor the AnimalClassTester class to use polymorphism when testing an object.
#### AnimalClassTester can be refactored to use the abstract Animal class as a parameter thus allowing any class extended with the asbtract Animal class to be used with it.

## Write the TreeClimbingOctopus class.
#### The TreeClimbingOctopus class can be written using the same abstract Animal class that the other animals use.

## You have succeeded if:
#### If the AnimalClassTester does not need to be modified to test the TreeClimbingOctopus class.
