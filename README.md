# HW7
## A link to your group's GitHub account which will have your group's source code
#### https://github.com/JsMailhot/HW7

## Describe any problems your group had writing the code
#### The only problems that I had writing the code is finding which way I preferred to accomplish the goals

## Did you change the classes that were tested?  Why or why not?
#### I changed the classes that were tested because they needed to utilize the abstract class' abstract functions to work with polymorphism

## Describe your team's solution.  Explain how it meets the criteria given.
#### The solution meets the criteria by extending the animal classes with an abstract class and giving the tests the ability to work with any class that extends the abstract class

## Do you think unit testing is important? Why or why not?
#### Unit testing is important because it points out problems in code and allows for corrections to be made so code works as intended

## Name 3 key parts of the Observer pattern
#### The three main components of the Observer pattern are the Subject, Observer and Client

## When would you use the Observer pattern?  What problem does it solve?
#### The Observer pattern is best utilized when testing similar components of multiple subclasses that utilize polymorphism as it solves the problem of adding new classes for testing by being dynamic

## Name 3 key parts of the Strategy pattern
#### The three main components of the Strategy pattern are the Context, Strategy and ConcreteStrategy

## When would you use the Strategy pattern?  What problem does it solve?
#### The Strategy pattern is best utilized when testing multiple different interface components during a test as it works well with that specific format of polymorphism which allows you to write more clean and concise code
